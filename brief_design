The Hootsuite Challenge

Design a small system that parses live data.
Stores it in a database and exposes it with filtering capabilities through an
HTTP API.

Use python to manipulate data from Reddit. Save it in mongo DB and use flask
to exposes it.

Create a small reddit wrapper that connects to a specific subreddit and extract
the newest submissions and comments.

Create a mongo DB wrapper that helps the save process.

Create a long-running python script that will periodically interrogate reddit for
the newest data. This script will run in background as a demon process, while
the flask server and mongoDB servers are up.

Create a flask server that exposes  a GET method for:

/items/?subreddit=<subreddit>&from=<t1>&to=<t2>

and

/items/?subreddit=<subreddit>&from=<t1>&to=<t2>&keyword=<keyword>
(keyword is optional)

Creating indexes for mongoDB queries. Adding index for subreddit, creation time
and text to have a faster search.

Using docker to have start app. Create container for long-running script, for
flask server and for mongoDB.

Add minimal test suite that tests the functionality.
